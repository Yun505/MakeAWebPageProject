    <p>Chronicles of me being me and daniel being hogun</p>

    <h2>How daniel became to be <em>hogun</em></h2>
    <pre>
        As we known Daniel is a common name that sounds like danile and is usually associated with fish.

        BUT one faithful day the BRIAN encountered the daniel in his natural habitat which is the cafeteria.

        The Daniel was faithfully eating a whole box of pizza at 2 A.M. much to the dismay of the other daniels.

        Then the brian took the pizza from the daniel and named him Hogun becuase of the law.

        The law being it was marvel reference U-U.

        The daniel accepted this with grace unlike the pizza incident and drank a soda of fizz. 

        They were no longer daniel no longer hogan but hogun, shortening their name forevermore. 

        THUS the legend of hogun came to be, not HOGUN that is a different species.
